# DOXA Rust 2.0 line

`doxa-tui` is the separate, tentative 2.0 frontend. The current Python DOXA
1.x release remains the supported application. The Rust binary is named
`doxa-rs` during development so installing it does not replace `doxa`.

The first milestone has a real terminal event loop, a client for DOXA's
versioned Unix-socket daemon, and a Markdown transcript presenter. It draws
grouped sessions and split panes, accepts prompts, handles resize and scroll,
and restores the terminal on exit. Existing daemon behavior and memory
authority remain on the Python side.

Build from this repository:

```sh
cargo build --manifest-path rust/doxa-tui/Cargo.toml
rust/doxa-tui/target/debug/doxa-rs --socket /path/to/existing/daemon.sock
rust/doxa-tui/target/debug/doxa-rs --list
rust/doxa-tui/target/debug/doxa-rs --session SESSION_ID
```

With one live daemon session, `doxa-rs` attaches to it directly. With multiple
sessions, use `--list` and select one by full ID or unique ID prefix.
`--socket` remains available for an explicit path. `--demo` opens the shell
without a connection. `Ctrl+Q` detaches the Rust UI
without stopping its daemon. The current alpha attaches to one socket and
renders text turns; permission dialogs, tool cards,
clickable links, aligned Markdown tables, drag dividers, and full transcript
restore are still 2.0 work. The binary version is `2.0.0-alpha.1` for this
separate development line, not a DOXA 2.0 release.

No 2.0 release tag is planned until the frontend reaches feature parity and
passes end-to-end terminal and daemon tests.

## Native daemon fixture

`doxa-daemon` is a native protocol v1 host process for lifecycle and transport
integration. Run `cargo build --manifest-path rust/doxa-daemon/Cargo.toml`, then
`rust/doxa-daemon/target/debug/doxa-daemon --cwd /path/to/project`. The process
prints no prompt or transcript data. Its Unix socket and owner-private registry
entry live under `DOXA_RUNTIME_DIR` when set, otherwise `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/doxa`
or `~/.local/share/doxa`. The registry's `daemon_socket` field can be passed to
`doxa-rs --socket` or used by Python `EngineClient`; it has the same hello,
attach, prompt, event, reply, and stop wire shapes as the Python daemon. `--linger`
sets seconds to wait after the last client detaches (default 120). An unclaimed
process gets at least 120 seconds for its first attach. SIGTERM and SIGINT stop
the socket and remove the registry entry.

The current host intentionally returns one fixed response for every prompt.
It does not call a real model, persist transcript or context, provide peer
messaging, support engine-specific RPCs, or run LORE review and indexing. The
registry reports `engine: fixture` to make this limit visible. Only `status`
and `stop` calls are supported; other calls return an explicit error. Its
`socket_path` points to the daemon socket for Python registry discovery, but
peer message frames are not implemented, so do not use this fixture as a peer
messaging target. This binary is for integration work, not user conversations.
