# Changelog

Newest first. Versions are annotated git tags on the commit that shipped
them (`v0.1.0` … `v0.5.0`); the ranges below are derived from that history,
not written from memory.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-08-23

- **`scripts/install.sh`** — a `curl | sh` installer, POSIX sh (tested
  against dash). Checks python3 (minimum read live from the target ref's
  own `pyproject.toml`, never a literal baked into the script), offers to
  install `uv` if it's missing (never silently), requires `git`, requires
  the `claude` CLI present *and* authenticated (`claude auth login`
  otherwise, and it stops there). Installs with
  `uv tool install --force git+https://github.com/docwilde/doxa` — never
  PyPI, DOXA isn't published there. Creates `~/.doxa` if absent, never
  touches an existing `config.toml`. Idempotent (a second run updates
  rather than refuses); pipe-safe (the whole script is one function called
  on the last line, so a `curl | sh` pipe truncated at any point runs
  nothing — verified by literally truncating the script at nine byte
  offsets and asserting no side effect). `sh -s -- v0.5.0` installs a
  specific tag instead of `main`'s HEAD. README's install section leads
  with the one-liner now, with an inspect-first alternative and the old
  `git clone` path kept as a fallback.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-08-23

- **Tabs are real sessions, and they say so.** `SessionPane` extraction under a `TabbedContent`: N sessions, one engine handle each, worker groups scoped per pane so a closed tab takes its workers with it. Ctrl+T spawns a fresh daemon in the same repo scope, Ctrl+W detaches it, Ctrl+Q ends it.
- **Tab labels: `Opus@doxa:main`** — short model tier, repo, branch (`branch@worktree` in a linked worktree when the name adds something). Truncation at 34 columns sacrifices the model first, the repo second, and protects the branch. Outside a repo the session names itself from its first turn with one cheap Haiku call, cached in `~/.doxa/names.toml`; the directory name stands in before it and permanently if it fails.
- **Rename a tab in place** — double-click the header (or `/rename`), Enter commits, Esc cancels, empty restores the automatic label. A named tab is pinned: model switches and branch changes stop rewriting it.
- **`/search`** — full-text search over LORE's session index, live in a popup above the prompt from the moment you type `/search `. Debounced, sequence-guarded (a slow query can never repaint over a newer one's results), FTS5 snippets with the matched terms highlighted by the index rather than by us. Empty query lists recent sessions. Replaced the Ctrl+R modal entirely; Ctrl+R now prefills the command, so there is one search path.
- **Terminal images** behind a KGP → sixel → half-block → text ladder, with a guaranteed text fallback; tool results carrying an image render it inside the chip, lazily on first expand.
- **Subagent trace tree** — a Task-spawned subagent's tool calls nest under its chip, foldable at every level, formatted only when opened.
- **Streaming deriver** (`DOXA_DERIVE_SECS`, opt-in) — debounced mid-session LORE review; proposals still wait for the same human gate.
- **Act-time belief consult** — a cite-only note on the prompt, FTS only, floor-gated (`DOXA_CONSULT_FLOOR`).
- **Command surface has ONE order.** Every row of the slash registry declares a functional group; the prompt's autocomplete, the Ctrl+P palette and generated `/help` all iterate the same sequence. The palette adds sections: New tab, the open tabs in tab-bar order with the active one marked, the grouped commands, then attachable sessions.
- **Status line**: context-pressure escalation by colour with the percentage kept in every tier, real subscription headroom read from the CLI's own cached utilization, the git sha marked as a commit (`@a1b2c3d`) beside the branch, and the detached-session handle labelled (`⌁ session a1b2c3d`) — two unlabelled hex strings in one bar read as one id printed twice.
- **`peers N (2⌁)`** — how many live peers, and how many are running detached. Counting now requires a socket that answers, not just a presence file; a launch sweep removes what a crash left behind and says how many.
- **`/sessions`** — every live session with age and attached/detached state, `kill <prefix>` and `kill-detached`.
- **Settings modal** (Ctrl+,) over one precedence rule — environment > `~/.doxa/config.toml` > default — showing the effective value and where it came from.
- **`/model` `/effort` `/usage` `/clear` `/compact` `/help`** — only as far as the SDK actually goes: `/model` switches live (a control request, no reconnect), `/effort` is honest that the SDK sets it at connect time only.
- **`/login` / `/logout`** through the provider's own auth CLI, with the precise plan tier read from the CLI's local config.
- **`/update`** — fast-forward this checkout from origin, never merge, never rewrite; refuses a dirty tree or a non-checkout, runs `uv sync` when the dependencies moved, reports the commits pulled and the version before → after. `--restart` is the explicit opt-in that stops this window's sessions and relaunches.
- **Version is single-sourced** from `pyproject.toml`, exposed as `doxa.__version__`, and shown in the session's identity block.
- **Nothing animates.** The in-flight marker lost its 16 Hz repaint timer, and Textual's own tab underline stopped sliding: measured at ~290–345 ms of extra wall time per tab switch, gone.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-23

- **Session daemon** — the engine moved out of the TUI into its own process, reachable over a Unix socket. Detach and reattach freely; a daemon outlives its last client by `--linger` seconds, then finalizes (LORE review + index) itself. `doxa`, `doxa new`, `doxa attach [prefix]`, `doxa stop [prefix]`.
- **Command palette** (Ctrl+P) with a DOXA provider and an attach picker fed by the shared registry.
- **History search** (Ctrl+R) — BM25 over LORE's session index, debounced as you type, inserting a text reference into the prompt rather than auto-sending anything.
- Ctrl+C quits: one press detaches, a second inside the window stops the sessions; the daemon's SIGINT path stays graceful.
- Idle CPU no longer grew with scrollback (hidden thinking indicators kept their animation timers armed).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-23

- **Peer layer** — same-repo session discovery through a 0700 runtime registry, presence heartbeats, and scrubbed peer messaging (`/peers`, `/msg`). A message is scrubbed at the receiving choke point, never at the display.
- **Native LORE tools behind a registry** — belief search/show, session search, `lore_remember` (which stages a proposal and never writes memory), each declared as data with its cost and read-only status.
- **PreToolUse containment gate** — two strikes and the tool is disabled for the session, said out loud in the status bar.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-23

- **Session engine** wrapping the Claude Agent SDK with LORE wired in-process, event-stream API, host-driven session-end review (there is no SessionEnd hook — see `PHASE0_FINDINGS.md`).
- **Single-pane Textual shell** over it: foldable turns, tool chips that format their arguments and results lazily on first expand, streaming text.
- Dark surface ramp, Claude orange, round borders; logo and wordmark.
- Phase 0 spikes that decided the architecture: minimal agent loop, lifecycle-hook investigation, Textual + `claude-agent-sdk` asyncio coexistence.
